SCSS variables are information about icon's compiled state, stored under its original file name

.icon-home {
  width: $icon-home-width;

The large array-like variables contain all information about a single icon
$icon-home: x y offset_x offset_y width height total_width total_height image_path;

At the bottom of this section, we provide information about the spritesheet itself
$spritesheet: width height image $spritesheet-sprites;

The provided mixins are intended to be used with the array-like variables

.icon-home {

/*
The `sprites` mixin generates identical output to the CSS template
  but can be overridden inside of SCSS
